üßº Code Quality Guidelines
‚úÖ Structure: Follow MVC pattern ‚Äî separate routes, controllers, models.

‚úÖ Best Practices:

Use async/await and try-catch for error handling.

Keep controllers thin ‚Äî logic should be in models or services.

Sanitize and validate inputs using middleware (e.g., Joi or express-validator).

‚úÖ Security:

Store passwords using bcrypt hashing.

Use .env for sensitive configs.

Validate JWTs using middleware.

‚úÖ Readability:

Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase).

Comment functions for clarity.

Keep functions small and focused.
